CMSC436 Final Project - Corsi Block Tapping Android Application


Corsi-Block Tapping (NIH).
The Corsi-Block Tapping task is a test of visuospatial memory. In this task, the individual is asked
to memorize a series of block that has been tapped by the test administrator, then tap the blocks
in the exact same order. On the computer, participants memorize a series of flashing blocks. There
are multiple rounds of testing, and the number of blocks to remember increases by one with each
round. If the participant does not tap the blocks in the correct flashing order, they are prompted
to redo that specific round one more time. If they miss the second round, the test terminates. The
data should record the highest number of blocks that the participant memorized and how long it
took the participant to complete the tapping task (for each round)
